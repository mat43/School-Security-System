<h1>Arduino Code For School Security System</h1>
<p>For ENGR 1182.02, our team was tasked to create a solution to a problem that concerns a specific user group. The user group we chose to focus on is high school administrators and the problem we chose to help resolve was maintaing building safety. To help resolve this problem, our team created a prototype which would be mounted in the entrances of schools. We used an Arduino Mega 2560, RFID sensor, and LCD screen which would allow access to a building when a valid student ID is tapped, and would stay locked when a invalid ID was tapped. In addition, this system logs student attendance automatically in an Excel sheet and notifies the attendance office if an invalid ID is scanned.</p>
